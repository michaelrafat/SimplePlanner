## Tools and Technologies used:
### - Android Studio
### - Broadcast Receiver
### - Push Notification
### - Room Database:
#### - Room is a database layer on top of an SQLite database. Room takes care of mundane tasks that you used to handle with an SQLiteOpenHelper . Room uses the DAO to issue queries to its database. By default, to avoid poor UI performance, Room doesn't allow you to issue database queries on the main thread.
